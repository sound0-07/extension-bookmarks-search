## Permissions Usage
The extension requires the bookmarks permission solely to access your bookmarks and provide its core search functionality. All data processing occurs locally on your computer. Your bookmarks are never sent to any remote server and are not stored by the extension.

We are committed to protecting your privacy. If you have any questions, please contact us at 'hansol13084@gmail.com'.
